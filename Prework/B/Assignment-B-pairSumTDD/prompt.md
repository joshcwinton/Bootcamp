<!-- ASSIGNMENT b: PAIRSUM -->

Given an array of numbers and a separate number (a "target"), determine if any two numbers (positioned at distinct indices) in the array add up to the sum. 

If any two numbers (positioned at distinct indices) in the array add up to the sum, return true. Otherwise, return false.

In the file titled "pairSum.js", write out the logic that would satisfy the conditions above within the body of the "pairSum" function (a function you have to write from scratch) on Line 11.

Please do not edit any other file or section of code. 

This assignment also serves as an opportunity to observe basic unit tests, potential error messages, and to ensure that all of us are familiar with setting up/interacting with REPLs on this platform and GitHub Gists.

Note: You might have to wait for the node modules/libraries to load up first/refresh the REPL. Clicking on the light-green "run >" button initially will begin that process and will also allow you to run/test your function after "pairSum" is written out.

Copy this REPL, modify it so that you pass all five of the test specs, copy your code (just the function) into a gist on GitHub, then include the link to your version of the REPL, and then e-mail the link to the GitHub Gist to the instructor (Allan James Lapid) at the following e-mail address: ajLapid718@gmail.com.

Please follow the previous protocol for submitting this assignment via GitHub Gist, REPL, and e-mail.
