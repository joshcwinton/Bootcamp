<!-- ASSIGNMENT D: REQUEST PARAMETERS AND REQUEST QUERIES -->

For this pre-work exercise, you'll be writing out the underlying logic for "captureParams()" and "captureQueryStrings" in the files "captureParams.js" and "captureQueryStrings.js", respectively.

Each file contains one test for that module, for a total of two tests overall.

This pre-work exercise serves as another opportunity to acclimate to JavaScript and to read test specs. This pre-work exercise also encompasses control flow, potentially nesting loops, scanning and parsing a string, and working with JavaScript keys, values, and object literals (JavaScript's version of a hash map or a dictionary).
