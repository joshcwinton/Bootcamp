# Javascript
- Client-side scripting language
- Runs on user's browser
- Defined by ECMAscript standard

## What is it used for?
- Show and hide
- Animate
- DOM is programatic representation of HTML elements


## Null vs. Undefined
- undefined typically means declared but not assigned

## Type coercion

## Falsey values
- `0`
- `''``
- `null`
- `undefined`
- `NaN`
- `false`

## Declaring Variables
- Three ways as of ES6
- `var`
  - Original method of declaring a variable in Javascript
  - Declared in global scope can be reassigned by other `var` declarations elsewhere in script/project
  - Only contained by local scope
- `let`
  - Introduced with ES6 in 2015
  - Cannot be ressigned by other `let` declarations of the same identifier in the same scope
  - Maintains block/lexical scope
    - If a variable is declared in a block it's not accessible outside of that block
- `const`
  - Cannot be reassigned anywhere at all
  - Maintains block/lexical scope
- Declaration vs. Definitions

# Declaring Functions

# Callback Functions
- Functions passed into other functions as arguments

# Array Methods
- `array.forEach()`
  - takes a callback and runs it on each item in the array, does not mutate array, does not return any values
- `array.map()`
- `array.reduce()`
